### Hi there, my name is Ruben

I'm a 19 year old guy out of Arizona that plans on making most of my projects based on what I learn on my own, one thing that I'm currently working on is a custom website to hold most of my portfolio on.

I'm also new but learning the whole GitHub thing so if you have any suggestions or comments that could help me out go ahead and reachout to me over on [twitter](https://twitter.com/loyaruben3).

Some of my interest include in learning Web Design, Game Design, and I started to pick up more on Software Engineering and Data Analytics.
